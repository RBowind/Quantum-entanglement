# ARTS-Week3

> ARTS(Algorithm,Review,Tip,Share)

I left office this week.As my charge said,"If you can't grow up and get paid enough,it's time to leave." So I told my resign plan to my charge ahead of time,and I think the handover needs one week at least. However,after the company failed to persuade me to stay,they just gave me one day to prepare the handover.Maybe it's time to pay for my social security and something else,or thought that I would be in terrible work situation during handover time,or whatever.

No matter what it is,the last day was a busy day which made me satisfied. Also,I felt nervous cause I thought this was a unprepared handover,means a bad ending.

Yes,I feel nervous up to now.Hope they have a happy starting and pay more attention to the tech team.
